  hacker
   n.
  
      [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]
  
      1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and
      how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to
      learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users' Glossary,
      usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate
      understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer
      networks in particular.
  
      2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.
